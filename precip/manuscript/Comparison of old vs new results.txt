Old vs new (changes as a result of corrections in demographic data)

TREATMENT EFFECTS

Growth:
ARTR significant treatment effects go away
HECO new estimates closer to zero
POSE new treatment effects are stronger 
PSSP Not much change

Survival:
ARTR little change
HECO little change
POSE little change
PSSP slight weaker effects now

Recruitment:
Negative effect of irrigation on POSE and PSSP go away (mostly)

CLIMATE EFFECTS (in new version, climate only affects intercept)

Growth:
ARTR: one different covariate selected, one barely significant
HECO: No change, two significant positive effects of soil moisture
POSE: No change
PSSP: No change

Survival:
All significant effects remain for all species, a bit stronger in some cases.
Changes in selection for non-significant covariates, one new significant effect (HECO)

Recruitment:
This is where the biggest changes are: most of the significant effects go away!

PREDICTIONS

Obs vs Pred 1 step ahead looks pretty much the same

Vital rate models:
ARTR predictions from climate model look even worse than before
HECO predictions, same story as before (climate model worse)
POSE: not much change, climate model still narrowly wins (maybe a bit more than before)
PSSP not much change, climate model still narrowly wins (maybe a bit more than before)
In general, for ARTR and HECO the climate model does a bit worse, and for POSE and PSSP the climate model does a bit better than before.
