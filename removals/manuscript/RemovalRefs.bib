  abstract = {Abstract. This paper reviews the literature on neighbour manipulation
	experiments on species intemctions in natural of semi-natural vegetation.
	Three major approaches have been used: 1) introductions into vegetation,
	2) trenching, and 3) vegetation removals. Some studies have used
	a combination of approaches, especially 1) and 3). The removal approach
	has been used most commonly and is given the greatest emphasis in
	this paper accordingly. Details of over 50 such studies are summarized
	here, 48 of which have appeared within only the last two decades.
	We compare and contrast the experimental designs of these studies
	and examine their contributions to the understanding of species interactions
	in vegetation. Evidence for competition is virtually universal among
	these studies. Several studies have also detected evidence of beneficence
	between plant species. Numerous factors may confound interpretations
	in removal experiments including: life stage dependent species responses,
	species-dependent timing and speed of response, inadequacy of controls
	due to temporal and/or spatial variability in site quality, indirect
	effects of treatment on soil moisture content or nutrient levels,
	or on the activities of predators or decomposers, and several constraints
	inherent in particular experimental designs. Another level of complexity
	arises as a consequence of several variables related to plant attributes
	that directly determine the nature of interactions between neighbours
	(e.g. relative competitive abilities, the magnitude of beneficial
	interactions, the extent to which neighbours make demands on the
	same resource units). These may interact in a complex manner to affect
	the response of a â€˜targetâ€™ plant to the removal of neighbours.
	Recommendations for future studies are considered and a neighbourhood
	experimental design is proposed which enables analysis of the extent
	to which the fates of naturally established individuals following
	vegetation removal can be accounted for (in multiple regressions)
	by several variables that reflect different properties and circumstances
	of interaction with immediate Thiessen neighbours in the field.},

	abundance not only through a direct effect on that speciesâ€™
	vital rates, but also through â€˜indirectâ€™ effects mediated
	by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases
	in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate,
	we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect
	effects. 2.â€‚For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions,
	we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change
	declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. 3.â€‚We
	tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized
	four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence
	in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences
	and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect
	effects of climate perturbations. 4.â€‚Consistent with our hypothesis,
	speciesâ€™ sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly

	Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive

	Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of
	the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three
	conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush steppe plant community
	in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical
	models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied
	the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life
	stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the
	critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was
	very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance
	was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger
	competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting
	low temporal variability in both competition and species responses
	to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species
	population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability
	had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study
	provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to
	the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage
	effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species
	performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results

  abstract = {Spatially periodic vegetation patterns, forming gaps, bands, labyrinths,
	or spots, are characteristic of arid and semiarid landscapes. Self-organization
	models can explain this variety of structures within a unified conceptual
	framework. All these models are based on the interplay of positive
	and negative effects of plants on soil water, but they can be divided
	according to whether they assume the interactions to be mediated
	by water redistribution through runoff/diffusion or by plants' organs.
	We carried out a multi-proxy approach of the processes operating
	in a gapped pattern in southwest Niger dominated by a shrub species.
	Soil moisture within the root layer was monitored in time and space
	over one month of the rainy season. Soil water recharge displayed
	no spatial variation with respect to vegetation cover, but the stock
	half-life under cover was twice that of bare areas. A kernel of facilitation
	by the aboveground parts of shrubs was parameterized, and soil water
	half-life was significantly correlated to the cumulated facilitative
	effects of shrubs. The kernel range was found to be smaller than
	the canopy radius (81\%). This effect of plants on soil water dynamics,
	probably through a reduction of evaporation by shading, is shown
	to be a better explanatory variable than potentially relevant soil
	and topography parameters. The root systems of five individuals of
	Combretum micranthum G. Don were excavated. Root density data were
	used as a proxy to parameterize a kernel function of interplant competition.
	The range of this kernel was larger than the canopy radius (125\%).
	The facilitation-to-competition range ratio, reflecting the above-to-belowground
	ratio of plant lateral extent, was smaller than 1 (0.64), a result
	supporting models assuming that patterning may emerge from an adaptation
	of plant morphology to aridity and shallow soils by means of an extended
	lateral root system. Moreover, observed soil water gradients had
	directions opposite to those assumed by alternative mathematical
	models based on underground water diffusion. This study contributes
	to the growing awareness that combined facilitative and competitive
	plant interactions can induce landscape-scale patterns and shape
	the two-way feedback loops between environment and vegetation},

	2m2 plots located inside and outside of large-mammal-proof exclosures.
	Species-cover data were collected for five years and analyzed by
	analysis of variance and diversity indices. In all three communities,
	protection from grazing and physical disturbance had greater impacts
	on species cover and diversity than removal of dominant species or
	fire. More species were significantly affected (positively and negatively)
	by disturbance and protection from grazing (50 - 100\%) than by species
	removals and fire ({\textless} 41\%). In most cases, the cover of
	tall, perennial species increased following protection from grazing
	while the cover of annual and short, perennial species decreased.
	Over the five years of the study, vegetatively reproducing species
	benefited more than sexually reproducing species from protection
	from grazing, and tall rhizomatous species benefited more than tall
	stoloniferous species. Disturbance caused annual and short perennial
	species to increase and tall perennials to decrease in cover. Following
	species removals, tall species were either unaffected or they increased
	in cover while some short species increased and others decreased
	in cover. Species diversity in two of the three communities decreased
	when the communities were protected from grazing but increased when

	a marker of mammal herbivory. Looking at the present distribution

	associated with two functional types of mammals: large browsers and
	medium-sized mixed feeders. Using a dated phylogeny for the same

	The diversification of spiny plants occurred long after the evolution
	of Afrotherian proboscideans and hyracoids. However, it is remarkably
	congruent with diversification of bovids, the lineage including the
	antelope that predominantly browse these plants today. Our findings
	suggest that herbivore-adapted savannas evolved several million years

	minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing
	because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions
	relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms
	are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms

	as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities
	and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms
	contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average
	fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing
	mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity
	slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing
	mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included

	worldwide are dominated by introduced plant species, leading to loss
	of biodiversity and ecosystem function. A common but rarely tested
	assumption is that these plants are more abundant in introduced vs.
	native communities, because ecological or evolutionary-based shifts
	in populations underlie invasion success. Here, data for 26 herbaceous
	species at 39 sites, within eight countries, revealed that species
	abundances were similar at native (home) and introduced (away) sites
	â€“ grass species were generally abundant home and away, while
	forbs were low in abundance, but more abundant at home. Sites with
	six or more of these species had similar community abundance hierarchies,
	suggesting that suites of introduced species are assembling similarly
	on different continents. Overall, we found that substantial changes
	to populations are not necessarily a pre-condition for invasion success
	and that increases in species abundance are unusual. Instead, abundance
	at home predicts abundance away, a potentially useful additional

	boreal forest understory communities. The 7\% removals were restricted
	to the numerically dominant species, the second most dominant species,
	or many lowâ€�abundance species, thereby separating the effects
	of species composition from those of biomass. We tested the effects
	of all removal treatments on seedling establishment. Competitive
	effects were driven by one dominant species and were inconsistent
	with resource complementarity, neutral, or competitionâ€�colonization
	models. Facilitative effects were apparent only following removal
	of all vegetation, of which the most dominant species comprised more
	than 80\%. Our results indicate that numerically dominant species
	in a community can influence the establishment of new species more
	than species diversity, but the direction of interaction can shift

	life histories, origins (invasive vs. native), climates, ecosystems

	Several periods of increased seedling emergence suggested responses

	trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key
	functional traitsâ€?wood density, specific leaf area and maximum
	heightâ€?consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast
	maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood
	density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area
	in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability
	to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours,

	effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with
	competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental
	ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant
	species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies.
	Competition within species was stronger than between species, but
	an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence

  abstract = {Abstract: 1. Survival, life expectancy and life span are key demographic
	parameters that are essential for understanding life-history evolution
	and forecasting population dynamics, but empirical data on these
	parameters is extremely limited for herbaceous species.
	
	2. We used long-term data from annually mapped permanent quadrats
	in a Kansas, USA, grassland to estimate survival, life expectancy
	and life span for 29 perennial forbs (herbaceous dicots) and 11 perennial
	grasses. In the cases of both forbs and grasses, they were the most
	common species at the research site.
	
	3. We developed computer programs to track the identity of individual
	genets based on their spatial locations in the permanent quadrats.
	The programs distinguished between new recruits and surviving individuals,
	and calculated the ages and life spans of the survivors.
	
	4. Most herbaceous perennials die young; life expectancy at age 1
	year ranged from 0.6 to 6.5. However, forbs are more likely to die
	young than grasses. Survival from age 1 to 2 years for forbs ranged
	from 0.11 to 0.49 with an average of 0.30, whereas for grasses it
	ranged from 0.30 to 0.63 with an average of 0.44. Maximum observed
	life spans ranged from 3 to 25 years for forbs and 5 to 39 years
	for grasses.
	
	5. All species tended towards Type III survivorship curves, but grasses
	were more strongly Type III while many forbs had relatively constant
	survival rates with age. Therefore, population models must account
	for increasing survival with age, especially for grasses.
	
	6. Age was a better predictor of grass survival than size, raising
	questions about the use of size-based methods to indirectly estimate
	survival and life span.
	
	7. Maximum observed life span was positively and significantly related
	with species importance.
	
	8. Synthesis. The higher survival, life expectancy and life span of
	grasses compared to forbs may provide a demographic explanation for
	community-level differences in the dominance and turnover of these
	two functional groups in grassland plant communities.}

  abstract = {In many species-rich hay meadows in Central Europe, the traditional
	extensive (low input, low output) management is no longer economical
	and meadows are either fertilized or abandoned. Both these practices
	lead to changes in species composition and usually to a loss in species
	diversity. The response of a species-rich meadow plant community
	to fertilization, mowing and removal of dominant species was studied
	in a manipulative factorial experiment over four years. Both species
	richness and seedling recruitment were positively influenced by mowing
	and to a lesser extent by removal of the dominant species, Molinia
	caerulea, and were negatively influenced by fertilization. Fertilization
	caused an immediate increase in community biomass. Response to removal
	of the dominant species was delayed by one season, continued over
	the whole period, and by the fourth year the biomass reached a similar
	value as in the plots with Molinia present. Changes in species composition
	were evaluated by RDA for repeated measurements. The best and only
	significant predictor of species response to fertilization was plant
	height. This shows that with increased nutrient availability, nutrient
	limitation weakens and competition for light becomes the decisive
	factor. Competition for light appears to be more asymmetric than
	competition for nutrients, and consequently, it is more likely to
	drive inferior species to extinction. This is, together with seedling
	recruitment limitations, the most important cause of a decrease in
	species richness under high nutrient levels. [References: 57]}

	dynamics from invasion and population persistence to extinction.
	Projections of population dynamics made in the absence of such fluctuations
	may consequently be misleading. However, data for estimation of yearly
	fluctuations in demographic parameters are often limited. Accordingly,
	the current diverse range of statistical and demographic modelling
	strategies used for stochastic population modelling may influence
	predictions.
	
	
	* We used simulations to explore the effects of different methods
	of parameter estimation on projections of population dynamics obtained
	using stochastic integral projection models (IPMs). The simulations
	were built from data on a monocarpic thistle, Carlina vulgaris, and
	an ungulate, Soay sheep, Ovis aries; these populations are subject
	to yearly fluctuation in vital rates facilitating the exploration
	of the effects of different methods of model construction on the
	properties of stochastic IPMs. Specifically, we looked at effects
	on the stochastic growth rate, log Î»s, and the mean and variance
	in the one-step population growth rate (Nt+1/Nt).
	
	
	* Our analyses showed that none of the tested approaches resulted
	in large biases in the estimation of log Î»s. However, when realistic
	study durations (e.g. 12Â years) were used for statistical modelling,
	the confidence intervals around the Î»s estimates remained large.
	Estimation of the variance in one-step population growth rates, on
	the other hand, was strongly sensitive to the method employed, and
	the overestimation and underestimation of the variance were also
	influenced by the life history of the organism.

	regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes
	and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate
	Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression
	models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian,
	controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response
	variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form
	owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov
	chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without
	problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In
	some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such
	that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate
	tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested
	Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly
	compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals.
	The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where
	Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our

	Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes

  abstract = {Temporal asynchrony among species helps diversity to stabilize ecosystem
	functioning, but identifying the mechanisms that determine synchrony
	remains a challenge. Here, we refine and test theory showing that
	synchrony depends on three factors: species responses to environmental
	variation, interspecific interactions, and demographic stochasticity.
	We then conduct simulation experiments with empirical population
	models to quantify the relative influence of these factors on the
	synchrony of dominant species in five semiarid grasslands. We found
	that the average synchrony of per capita growth rates, which can
	range from 0 (perfect asynchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony), was higher
	when environmental variation was present (0.62) rather than absent
	(0.43). Removing interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity
	had small effects on synchrony. For the dominant species in these
	plant communities, where species interactions and demographic stochasticity
	have little influence, synchrony reflects the covariance in species’
	responses to the environment.},
